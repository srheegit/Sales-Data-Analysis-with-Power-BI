We analyze a delivery service company's sales data using Power BI, creating a Power BI Report that answers relevant business questions that are outlined in the [Goal of the Power BI Report section](#Goal-of-the-Power-BI-Report).

## Business Requirement Document

We work with our delivery service company's data. There are four policies that the company is governed under:

1. Customers can place orders for various products sold by the company online.
2. Company delivers the product in least possible time depending upon the customers address.
3. Customers can choose either cash on delivery option or they can pay online while placing the order.
4. Company follows 10 days return policy.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consits of 4 csv files containing sales data for 4 months, with one csv file corresponding to one month of the following: January 2019, February 2019, Marhc 2019, and April 2019.

Each csv file contains the following columns:

1. Order ID
2. Product: the ordered product's name
3. Quantity delivered
4. Price Each
5. Order Date
6. Purchase address: customer's address

## Goal of the Power BI Report

We shall seek to create a Power BI Report that answers the following questions:

1. What are top/bottom 5 products by sales?
2. Sales by region
3. All details about the products ordered in a given order
4. Number of orders by date
5. Sales by month
6. Number of orders by month
7. Relationship between sales and quantity ordered

## Process of Creating the Power BI Report

I first divided the dashboard into three sections: the top for the company's logo and titole, the left section for sliders, and the rest for KPIs, maps, and charts. To add visual engagement, I imported and included several small icons relevant to several KPIs, such as money bag for sales and a box for the number of products sold.

For coherence in design, I used yellow and blue, the two colors prominent in the company's logo, throughout my visualization.
